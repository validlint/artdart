 Landing page that I've started to build as a Pen at CodePen.io. You can find its first version at http://codepen.io/Sestri4kina/pen/EyErkY.

 UPDATE 26.12: I've changed a structure of the project - added gulpfile.js and package.json.
 Also I've added gulp-sass for quick start with SCSS.
 UPDATE 28.07: Responsive Design. "Mobile first" mantra makes me go back to my previous works
 to make them responsive :)
 Landing page is a task for the third day of the "Daily UI" challenge.
 I loved to think through layout, match colors and be all designer working on this task.
